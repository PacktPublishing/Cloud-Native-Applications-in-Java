This is the code repository for [Cloud-Native Applications in Java](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cloud-native-applications-java?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787124349), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Businesses today are evolving so rapidly that they are resorting to the elasticity of the cloud to provide a platform to build and deploy their highly scalable applications. This means developers now are faced with the challenge of building build applications that are native to the cloud. For this, they need to be aware of the environment, tools, and resources they’re coding against.

If you’re a Java developer who wants to build secure, resilient, robust, and scalable applications that are targeted for cloud-based deployment, this is the book for you. It will be your one stop guide to building cloud-native applications in Java Spring that are hosted in On-prem or cloud providers - AWS and Azure

The book begins by explaining the driving factors for cloud adoption and shows you how cloud deployment is different from regular application deployment on a standard data centre. You will learn about design patterns specific to applications running in the cloud and find out how you can build a microservice in Java Spring using REST APIs

You will then take a deep dive into the lifecycle of building, testing, and deploying applications with maximum automation to reduce the deployment cycle time. Gradually, you will move on to configuring the AWS and Azure platforms and working with their APIs to deploy your application. Finally, you’ll take a look at API design concerns and their best practices. You’ll also learn how to migrate an existing monolithic application into distributed cloud native applications.

By the end, you will understand how to build and monitor a scalable, resilient, and robust cloud native application that is always available and fault tolerant.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The Dropbox link for the required softwares and hardware requirements along with installation steps:

The code will look like the following:
```
-- Adding a few initial products
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (1, 'Apples', 1) 
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (2, 'Oranges', 1) 
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (3, 'Bananas', 1) 
insert into product(id, name, cat_Id) values (4, 'Carrot', 2) 
```

The book starts with an introduction and then builds on a simple service, step by step, through the chapters. Hence, the readers will benefit by following the flow of the book, unless they are looking for a particular topic.
Downloading the code and running it is always tempting. However, you will benefit more as you type the code out, especially in the initial chapters. The book is written in such a way that the important concepts and code are present in the chapter, thus preventing you from going back to see the source code.
Having said that, do try out the code samples and run them. It makes the principles concrete and easier to grasp. 
I hope that you have invested in a good desktop/laptop, given that you will be running containers and VMs on your machine, which take resources, it is good to have a strong piece of equipment to get going. 
Refer to the documentation links mentioned through the chapters to expand the knowledge on the frameworks and technologies discussed in the book.
The cloud is a technology that changes very rapidly. Hence, this book stresses on concepts and demonstrates them through code. For example, CQRS is important as a concept, so we have shown implementation on MongoDB and Elasticsearch. However, you can try out the pattern on any other set of databases.
